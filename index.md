Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas), which produces heat-trapping gases.

#### Key Impacts:
* **Rising global temperatures:** Leading to hotter summers and more frequent heatwaves.
* **Changing precipitation patterns:** Causing more intense droughts in some regions and heavier rainfall/flooding in others.
* **Melting glaciers and ice caps:** Contributing to sea-level rise.
* **Ocean acidification:** Affecting marine life and ecosystems.

It's crucial for us to understand these changes and work towards sustainable solutions to mitigate their effects. Every small action contributes to a greener future.
